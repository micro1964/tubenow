cached-path-relative\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n\nMemoize the results of the path.relative function. `path.relative` can be an expensive operation if it happens a lot, and its results shouldn't change for the same arguments.\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install cached-path-relative\n\n## Usage\n\nUse it just like your normal path.relative, but it's memoized:\n\n```javascript\nvar relative = require('cached-path-relative')\n\n\nrelative('test/index.js', '.') === '../..'\n```\n\n## Shim\n\nIf you want to shim path.relative globally so that you can optimize things that don't know about this module (browserify rebuild times are a good use-case here), you can just import the shim:\n\n`require('cached-path-relative/shim')`\n\nThis will globally shim `path.relative` so that its results are cached.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2016,
